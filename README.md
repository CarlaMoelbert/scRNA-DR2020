# Introduction
This is the code repository for the preprint "Towards a Comprehensive Evaluation of Dimension Reduction Methods for Data Visualization". This repository is organized as follows:

- [preprocessing](./preprocessing/): scripts that are used for preprocessing each dataset
- [experiments](./experiments/): scripts that are used for experiments, including the dimensionality reduction of each algorithm and the evaluation
- [figures](./figures/): scripts that are used for figure creation
- [output](./output/): raw embeddings generated during the experiments
- [results](./results/): evaluated results from the experiments
